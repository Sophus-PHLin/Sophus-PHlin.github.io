# Seminar on Quantum Mechanics

Introduction: This is a discussion class on quantum mechanics in Peking University. The teacher-in-charge is Prof. Feng Xu (冯旭). At the beginning of this class, the teacher assign about 30 topics related to quantum mechanics, concerning advanced quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, atomic, molecular physics and optics, quantum information, condensed matter physics and so on. We can choose two topics on ourselves and give an 1-hour presentation on each one.

My two presentation topics are "Hartree-Fock methods" and "Theory of cuprate superconductivity". Here are the presentation slides (in Chinese):

There might still be mistakes. Feel free to point them out.
