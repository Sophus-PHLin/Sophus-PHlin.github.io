[Ya. S. Druskin "Plants" ("Aurora". 1989. No. 6)]

> Vvedensky never abandoned the "star of nonsense" until the very end. His works become increasingly profound and complex over time—the "star of nonsense" deepens, but at the same time becomes clearer: the style and character of the work become so clear and transparent that I sense absurdity, illogicality, nonsense as my own, precisely my illogical, absurd existence; I no longer see their illogicality. On the contrary, logic, as Vvedensky shows me, is something completely alien to me, external; logic itself, Aristotle's logic itself begins to seem absurd to me. But nonsense is not relative. It is an absolute reality—it is the Logos made flesh. This personal Logos itself is illogical, just as His incarnation is. But this nonsense has become an understanding of my existence. It is impossible to understand nonsense: understood nonsense is no longer nonsense. Nor is it possible to seek the meaning of nonsense; The meaning of nonsense is the same, if not greater, nonsense. The "star of nonsense" is that which cannot be [heard with the ears](https://Sophus-PHLin.github.io/files/叶戈尔·列托夫如是说-1.pdf), [seen with the eyes]((https://Sophus-PHLin.github.io/files/叶戈尔·列托夫如是说-2.pdf)), or [understood with the mind](https://Sophus-PHLin.github.io/files/叶戈尔·列托夫如是说-3.pdf).
