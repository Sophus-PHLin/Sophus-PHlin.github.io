In spring 2025, I took the class "Group theory II" (Lie groups and Lie algebras) by Prof. Yuxin Liu (刘玉鑫). Because of the retirement of a professor, the course schedule this year was adjusted, and this class, originally taught by Prof. Yinan Wang (王一男), was assigned to Prof. Yuxin Liu, who taught this class before 2020. To my opinion, Prof. Liu's class seems to be better, because it has a broader context, explains everything clearly without involving complex mathematical concepts, and introduces physical applications (especially in nuclear theory) in detail.

## Reference books

The main reference book is Prof. Yuxin Liu's 《物理学家用李群李代数》(Lie groups and Lie algebras for physicists), and I found the book 《物理学中的群论（第二版）》(Group theory for physicists (second edition)) by 马中骐 (Zhongqi Ma) useful. Other references books include:
- Barut and Raczka, Theory of Group Representations and Applications.
- Hamermesh, Group theory and its application to physical problems.
- Wybourne, Classical Groups for Physicists.
- 万哲先 (Zhexian Wan), 李代数 (Lie algebra).
- Iachello and Arima, The Interacting Boson Model.
- Iachello and Levine, Algebraic theory of molecules.

## Essay

We were required to write an essay on any topic about Lie group and Lie algebras. I chose the topic "Branching rules and Gelfand-Tsetlin bases of the classical Lie algebras".
