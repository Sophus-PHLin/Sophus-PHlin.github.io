## Education
* B.S. in Physics, Peking University, Sep 2023 - Jun 2027
* Summer Research Intern, Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Jun 2025 - Sept 2025

## Research Interests
My current research interests lie in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics, particularly
* The interplay between topology and interactions in crystalline materials;
* Transport phenomena and quantum kinetics in mesoscopic systems;
* Electronic properties and quasiparticle excitations in classical and quantum solid-state materials.

I am also eager to learn, explore, and challenge myself across a broader range of topics, both within and beyond condensed matter physics.

## Research Experience
* Transport Phenomena in Spin and Orbital Hall Effects (Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Jun 2025 - Sept 2025)
  * Kinetics of Phonon Scattering
  * Contribution of Single Impurity Scattering to Spin and Orbital Hall Effects in Confined Geometries
  * Spin and Orbital Hall Effects Under Periodic (Floquet) Driving
* Unbiased Theoretical and Numerical Evidence for Fractional Chern Insulator Phases in Multilayer Rhombohedral Graphene (Peking University, Feb 2025 – Jun 2025)
* Hartree-Fock Study of Correlation in Topological Flat Bands (Peking University, Jul 2024 – Jan 2025)
* Quantum Geometry in Magnetic Systems (Peking University, Oct 2024 – Jan 2025 & Sept 2025 - )

## Skills
* Programming: Python (fluent with experience in scientific computing and numerical simulations), Mathematica, LaTeX.
* Language: Chinese (native), English (GRE 333, TOEFL 110), German (beginner level), Japanese (elementary level). I am also an amateur in historical linguistics.
* Mathematics and Physics Sciences: 
  * Strong theoretical foundation in both mathematics and physics, with proficiency in analytical derivations, qualitative reasoning, and approximative methods. Experienced in self-directed learning from textbooks, research literature, and online resources. Core competencies include quantum mechanics, solid-state physics, and quantum many-body theory.
  * Familiar or acquainted with a wide range of topics in modern condensed matter theory, including: (1) Quantum many-body and field-theoretical methods applied to transport, quantum kinetics, and superconductivity; (2) Non-perturbative numerical approaches such as tensor networks (e.g., NRG, DMRG), dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), and exact diagonalization; (3) Topological phases of matter. (4) Phenomenological theories.
