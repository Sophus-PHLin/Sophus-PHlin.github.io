I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at Peking University's School of Physics.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, specifically in topological, correlation and emergent phenomena in real crystal materials.

I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song](https://icqm.pku.edu.cn/yw/directory/faculty/932182.htm)'s group now.
