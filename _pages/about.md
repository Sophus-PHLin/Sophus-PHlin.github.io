I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at School of Physics, Peking University.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, especially topological and transport properties of mesoscopic systems. I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=85T_dPEAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group now.

I'm also interested in languages and lingustics. I can speak Chinese and English, and I'm now learning German, Russian and Japanese. I am interested in the field of **historical linguistics**, including classification of language families, the reconstruction of proto languages, phonetic changes, and writing systems.

I like Japanese and Russian music. My favorite bands and singers include:
- Japanese: `Takahashi Yuu`, `Amazarashi`, `Tuyu`, `Roselia`, `Sakanaction`, `Afterglow` and many others.
- Russian: `Kino`, `DDT`, `Molchat Doma`.
- Deutsch: `Rammstein`.
