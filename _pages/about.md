I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at Peking University's School of Physics.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, specifically topological, correlation and emergent phenomena in actual crystalline materials. I'm also interested in languages. I can speak Chinese and English, and I'm learning Japanese and Russian now.

I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song](https://icqm.pku.edu.cn/yw/directory/faculty/932182.htm)'s group now.
