I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at School of Physics, Peking University.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, especially topological and transport properties of mesoscopic systems. I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song(宋志达)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=85T_dPEAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group now.

I'm also interested in languages and lingustics. I can speak Chinese and English, and I'm now learning German, Russian and Japanese. I am interested in the field of **historical linguistics**, including classification of language families, the reconstruction of proto languages, phonetic changes, and writing systems.

I like music. My favorite bands and singers include:
- Japanese: `Takahashi Yuu`, `Amazarashi`, `Sakanaction`, `Tuyu` (Japanese folk-rock and electronics).
- Russian: `Kino`, `DDT`, `Akvarium`, `Molchat Doma` (Soviet new-wave).
- German: `Rammstein`, `Oomph!` (Neue Deutsche Härte).
