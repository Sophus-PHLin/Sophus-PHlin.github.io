I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at School of Physics, Peking University.

I'm currently interested in condensed matter physics theory, especially topological and transport properties of mesoscopic systems. I'm also interested in languages and lingustics. I can speak Chinese and English, and I'm now learning German, Russian and Japanese. I like Japanese and post-Soviet music. My favorite bands and singers are `Kino`, `DDT`, `Takahashi Yuu`, `Amazarashi`, `Tuyu`, `Roselia` and many others.

I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=85T_dPEAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group now.
