I'm Sophus, a second-year undergraduate student at School of Physics, Peking University.

I'm interested in condensed matter physics theory<!-- ,especially topological and transport properties of mesoscopic systems -->. I'm doing undergraduate research in [Prof. Zhida Song(宋志达)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=85T_dPEAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group.
